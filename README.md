# Puppy Pacman
Puppy Pacman is a game made using the Lua Love2D framework, and it is also my venturing into game development.
The goal of the game is to get kibble pieces while avoiding enemies, and sometimes bones spawn that make enemies vulnerable.

# Why?
I'm excited about using Lua because I really like it, and I'm also practicing game development.
