--[[

LÃ–VE, or Love2D, is a Lua framework that allows you to make 2D games,
an easy-to-learn embedded language that is widely used for game development.
Love2D is not considered a game engine because it has no UI for creating games.

PACMAN COMPONENTS
- Pacman (Puppy/Player)
- Ghost (Enemy)
- Pellets that spawn randomly (Kibble)
- Power Pellets that make ghosts vulnerable (Bones)

    -- Player height and width
    player.height = player.sprite:getHeight() * 0.05 -- The height is the height of the image multiplied by 0.05 because that's what it's scaled to when it's drawn
    player.width = player.sprite:getWidth() * 0.05 -- The width is the width of the image multiplied by 0.05 because that's what it's scaled to when it's drawn
end

-- Function to draw items to the screen
function love.draw()
    love.graphics.draw(player.sprite, player.x, player.y, 0, 0.05, 0.05) -- Draw the player sprite at it's x and y values, with a rotation of 0 degrees and at a scale of 0.05
    love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 1) -- Set the color of all graphics to white (RGB values have a maximum of 1)

    -- Draw a square using coordinates
    love.graphics.line(0, 0, 800, 0) -- Top line (0, 0) to (800, 0)
    love.graphics.line(0, 0, 0, 600) -- Left line (0, 0) to (0, 600)

        player.x represents the left side of the sprite because it is where the sprite is drawn from.
        player.y represents the top side of the sprite because it is where the sprite is drawn from.
        Images (the player sprite in this case) are drawn from a (0, 0) point so therefore player.x is 0 and player.y is 0, making them the top left corner.

        player.width represents the right side of the sprite because it is where the sprite stops being drawn.
        player.height represents the bottom side of the sprite because it is where the sprite stops being drawn.
        This is because is it where the image ends.

        We add player.x to player.width and player.y to player.width to get the right side or bottom side of the sprite at any time.
        By adding player.x or player.y, the width and height become values that are relative to the origin (0, 0) of the sprite.
        So if the sprite's origin (top left side) is at (255, 255) and it is 64x64, the bottom right side would be at (319, 319).
